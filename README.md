A chess engine. Very cold. Brr.

Rename engine functions to be prefixed with 'engine' (same with interface) (or remove interface.c altogether?)

// Name moves
// Interact with player
// Castling (including attacked square rule)
// Stalemate detection
// Threefold repetition
// 50-move rule
// Killing king is a terminal node
